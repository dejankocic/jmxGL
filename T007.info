Test ID : T007
Test Name : T007-SendGPSLocs
Test Scenario: Send GPS locations for drivers (firts log-in as a driver to get a token)
Test repetition: number of GPS locations in the sample data

Test Requirements: 
Database - registered drivers with DA credentials
Sample files 
      - T007_drivers.data a CSV file with ; as separator, 
      - T007_gpslocs.data a CSV file with ; as separator, 
      Tnnn-data.xls(T007_gps, T007_drivers) can be used for easier creation.
      
Sample Data
Sample T007_drivers.data are populated with
- driver name 
- driver password
 
Sample T007_gpslocs.data are populated with
- driver	- driver name 
- lat	- Latitude component for GPS location
- lon	- Longitude component for GPS location
- hacc	- horizontal accuracy
- vacc  - vertical accuracy

Test result: 
- none, I don't know app where someone can track driver positions except mobile app

*NOTE* - First sending  of the GPS location for particular driver is always failed, 
because token is not yet validated at that time, further sendings are OK.
